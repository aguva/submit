Description: sendmail program for multi-user systems
 submit is a daemon-less mail transfer agent for multi-user Unix systems.
 In contrast to other MTAs, it moves the configuration of non-local mail
 delivery away from system administrators and towards the individual
 users.  Notable features are:
 .
  * sendmail(8)-compatible command line interface.
  * Support for SMTP and Sendmail transports:  submit can relay mails
    through smarthosts as well as interface with other sendmail programs
    (such as those provided by Postfix, Exim or the original Sendmail).
  * Synchronous delivery:  When submit returns successfully, you can be
    sure that your mail is out.
  * SSL/TLS support, including CA- and fingerprint-based validation
    of the serverâ€™s identity and certificate-based authentication.
  * Pluggable interfaces (currently GTK+ and TTY) for authentication.
  * Optional daemon process storing SMTP passwords and passphrases to
    private keys.
  * Optional support for different delivery methods depending on the
    sender address selected in the mail client.
