Description: sendmail program for multi-user systems
 submit is a replacement or supplement implementation of the sendmail
 command line interface for multi-user Unix systems.  It moves the
 configuration of non-local mail delivery away from system
 administrators and towards the individual users while still being able
 to interface with sendmail programs provided by mail transfer agents
 such as the original Sendmail, Postfix or Exim.  Notable features are:
 .
  * Synchronous delivery:  When submit returns successfully, you can be
    sure that your mail is out.
  * Supports SMTP and Sendmail transports.
  * SSL/TLS support, including CA- and fingerprint-based validation
    of the serverâ€™s identity and certificate-based authentication.
  * Pluggable interfaces:  Install python-gtk2 for GTK+ authentication
    dialogs and python-gnome2-desktop for GNOME Keyring support.
  * Optional daemon process storing SMTP passwords and passphrases to
    private keys.
  * Optional support for different delivery methods depending on the
    sender address selected in the mail client.
