	 submit — sendmail replacement for multi-user desktops
	=======================================================

Introduction
------------

submit is a daemon-less mail transfer agent for multi-user Unix systems.
In contrast to other MTAs, it moves the configuration of non-local mail
delivery away from system administrators and towards the individual
users.  Notable features are:

 * sendmail(8)-compatible command line interface.
 * Support for SMTP and Sendmail transports:  submit can relay mails
   through smarthosts as well as interface with other sendmail programs
   (such as those provided by Postfix, Exim or the original Sendmail).
 * Synchronous delivery:  When submit returns successfully, you can be
   sure that your mail is out.
 * SSL/TLS support, including CA- and fingerprint-based validation
   of the server’s identity and certificate-based authentication.
 * Pluggable interfaces (currently GTK+ and TTY) for authentication.
 * Optional daemon process storing SMTP passwords and passphrases to
   private keys.
 * Optional support for different delivery methods depending on the
   sender address selected in the mail client.

Mail user agents that work fine with submit include Mutt, Pine/Alpine,
Evolution and KMail.  Sylpheed/Claws Mail and Thunderbird/Icedove have
been determined not to be usable.

Installation
------------

If your distribution provides submit packages, please use them.  They
know how to deal with overriding the default sendmail program shipped
with your mail transport agent.

If you have to manually install submit, please become root and type

	# python setup.py install

to install the submit libraries as a site-local package for Python and
the submit binary to /usr/bin.  You can now either reconfigure your
programs to use /usr/bin/submit instead of /usr/{lib,sbin}/sendmail, or
figure out how your distribution handles custom replacements of files
normally shipped with stock packages.  See the submit manual, section
“Installation”, for some pointers.

WARNING: Never install submit as /usr/{lib,sbin}/sendmail!  This will
	 inevitably lead to submit calling itself over and over when
	 trying to deliver local mails.  Symlinking /usr/bin/submit to
	 /usr/{lib,sbin}/sendmail is safe, though.

Basic Configuration
-------------------

To make submit deliver mails to SMTP relays, create a ~/.submit
directory and place a file named “config” in there:

	# ~/.submit/config example file
	[method remote]
	type = smtp
	host = mail.example.com		# replace this
	username = your_user_name	# replace this
	starttls = on			# use Transport Layer Security

This should do for many free mail providers.
